ANOVA is used to analyze how the varible can influence the objective function.

step:
1.run train.py to train the surrogate model(ANN) for this function
2.run ANOVA_scatter.py

note: the definition of ANOVA is integrated, however the calculation time for integration for a function with many varible is too long (ANOVA_integrate_2D.py)
so we use the scatter form of ANOVA
